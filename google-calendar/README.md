# Plugin for Google Calendar Video Conference Creation

This project is intended for integration with Google Workspace and adds the ability for all employees to create video conferences directly from a Calendar event.

By "creating a conference" we mean generating a valid meeting link that, when opened, performs all the necessary actions to join the meeting.

The meeting name is generated randomly with simple template. Feel free to set any template, but generated. It's more simplier to change room name from another interface rather from calendar.
